If the puzzle box was constructed with the intention that one specific person should be able to open it, that person gets a +5 circumstance bonus on the check.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"puzzleBox","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Entertainment"]]},"subType":"tradeGoods","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"sort":2700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/sundries/gaming/dice-runed-brown.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"J0DwkHV4LUN66s0T","name":"Rounders gear","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Rounders gear</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 92</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 1 sp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Entertainment<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>Players of this game divide into teams and alternate hitting a small, leather-encased ball with a wooden bat.

Tengus have developed an extensive code of signals and can use their kites to display complex messages visible at great distances. A signal kite kit includes six small colored kites that can be hooked together in different patterns to facilitate complex messages. The kit also includes a spool and 300 feet of twine.

Its twine is strengthened by soaking it in glue and sometimes with crushed glass to give it a slight cutting edge. The kite has hardness 5 and 3 hit points. Participants in a kite battle make alternating sunder combat maneuvers against each other's kites; each successful maneuver allows a competitor to roll 1d6 points of damage against the opponent's kite. When a kite reaches 0 hit points, it is broken or its string is cut, and its player loses the match. In some matches, points are awarded for touching the kite's top to the opponent's string, with the winner being the first to reach a set point total. Those interested in kite-fighting may select the terror kite as a weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization, and apply these bonuses on kite damage rolls and on their sunder combat maneuver attempts made while using terror kites.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":20,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Terror kite","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"terrorKite","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Entertainment"]]},"subType":"tradeGoods","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/cloth/yarn-skein-white-grey.webp","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

A candle made from alchemical candle wax normally possesses a sweet, honeylike smell, but a character who is trained in Craft (alchemy) can infuse the wax with nearly any scent available to her. A character trained in both Craft (alchemy) and Craft (poison) can infuse one candle's worth of wax with any alchemical substance that requires inhalation, such as a vial of alchemical pheromones (see below) or a dose of inhaled poison. When infusing the wax with poison, the normal rules for exposing oneself to poison apply. Only one kind of alchemical substance can be infused into a single candle at a time, though a single candle can hold up to 3 doses of a substance. A single lump of alchemical candle wax is enough to create one candle.<br/><br/> After burning for 1 minute, the alchemical candle releases the chosen alchemical substance as a colorless haze that lingers in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle for up to 1 hour, plus 30 minutes for each dose or vial of a substance infused into the candle wax beyond the first. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the haze in 2 rounds; a strong or stronger wind (21+ mph) disperses the haze immediately.

Each use of the kit changes either hair or skin color. If you need to change both your hair color and your skin color, you must spend two uses of the kit to gain the benefit. Each dye takes 1 minute to apply (thus requiring 2 minutes to change both hair and skin color). Once applied, the colors are waterproof, and can't be rubbed or burned away.

When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":75,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bonePaste","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":4700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/slime-white.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"Uy7lE2zT1rJPE1z2","name":"Bone Reed","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/> Bone Reed</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Wilderness pg. 153</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 75 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Herbs<br/><strong>Gather</strong> DC 24; <strong>Yield</strong> 1 dose<br/><strong>Terrain</strong> any swamps<br/><strong>Preparation</strong> A bone reed must be pressed and dried.

By giving the handle a sharp twist you break a tiny glass ampoule just inside the bladder, filling the bag with buoyant gas and causing it to swell into a 3-foot-diameter sphere. Inflating the balloon is a move action. Once filled, the balloon floats upward at a speed of 60 feet per round. The balloon can lift up to 20 pounds of weight as it rises, though carrying more than 10 pounds reduces its speed to 30 feet per round. Multiple balloons attached to a single object add their carrying capacities together when determining how much weight they can lift. If a balloon is not held or bound in place in some manner, it continues to rise until it reaches a height of 600 feet, or until 10 minutes have passed, after which it pops or deflates and is destroyed.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 15","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":10,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"buoyantBalloon","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":5500000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/orb-tassle-blue-yellow.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"VLEhAxUjI3lQ3ZnA","name":"Burner","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Burner</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>People of the Sands pg. 28</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 3 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>A burner is a metal or ceramic cylinder, open at the top and perforated with air holes along the sides, often with sliding vents to open or close these apertures as the fire inside requires.

Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan; it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder. This item only works on oreads and other creatures with rocklike bodies.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"camouflageLichen","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":5800000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/flowers/buds-red-green.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"oCAy4winUnOyKtAO","name":"Candlerod","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Candlerod</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 103</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>Similar to but weaker than a sunrod, this stick glows like a candle when struck and lasts for 12 hours.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":1,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"candlerod","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":5900000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/sundries/lights/torch-brown.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"ypQQtvmTTwKUltGW","name":"Caphorite Dust","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Caphorite dust</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Kobolds of Golarion pg. 29</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 25 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This small leather pouch is filled with a faintly radioactive ore called caphorite, with a small percentage of reactants that activate the dust.

Four or more doses applied to the same part of the body glow as a torch for 24 hours. The alchemical reaction of the ink to the target's skin and body heat is painful and irritating, giving the target the sickened condition while the glow lasts.

Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item.

Alternatively, a spellcaster holding an unused vial of light of Axtarr can expend it as a free action to automatically succeed at a caster level check to cast a fire spell underwater.

When introduced into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check. A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect's duration has expired.<br/><br/> If an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.<br/><br/> When ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.<br/><br/> Crafting necrobane formaldehyde requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 23","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":60,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"necrobaneFormaldehyde","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":18700000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"KhXeRYDyge9kAX7E","name":"Necrosalt","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Necrosalt</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Undead Slayer's Handbook pg. 15</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 150 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>The powder in this minute glass vial is made of caustic soda treated with consecrated ashes, and is harmless to living flesh but dangerous to the deceased.

When the cover is removed and the ooze is exposed to air, the user has 1 minute to handle the rapidly softening ooze before it regains its former viscosity (as well as toxicity) and springs back to life. Although much smaller than an actual ooze creature, this coin-sized blob still deals 1d6 points of acid damage to anything it comes in contact with. Due to its unpredictable nature, petrified ooze is typically only good for breaking or melting whatever object or device on which the user originally sets the ooze, after which the blob quickly scurries into the nearest corner or crevice so it can feed on particles of dust and diminutive prey. Once restored to its viscous form, a petrified ooze moves at a rate of 60 feet per round, and any creature that comes in contact with the ooze must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid taking acid damage from it.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 25","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":80,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"petrifiedOoze","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":21400000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/slime-yellow.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"fTZHGZYAwKc7J3PQ","name":"Phosphorescent Gel","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Phosphorescent gel</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Dungeoneer's Handbook pg. 27</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 45 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This sealed vial contains 1 ounce of milky white gel.

It allows the wearer to deliver a dose of contact or ingested poison by means of a kiss. This kiss can be to the hand, cheek, or other exposed skin to deliver a contact poison, but must be on the mouth for an ingested poison. A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous. To use poison lip paint without being exposed to the poison, the wearer must first apply a protective layer of base material. When using an ingested poison, the wearer can instead consume an antidote prior to application. (When the user applies a contact poison, preemptively consuming an antidote results in the wearer's skin harmlessly absorbing the poison, as does immunity to poison.) A kit contains enough base material and lip paint for 10 doses. The poisons must be purchased separately and mixed into the lip paint.

The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn, roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next. On a 1, it continues forward in the same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier). On a 2, it turns 45* clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90* clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on.

Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":5,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"weaponBlanchSilver","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":29300000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/laboratory/bowl-liquid-pink-yellow-green.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"TnIdY2cfKPMX5ZPv","name":"Wild-Blood Concoction","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Wild-blood concoction</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 27</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 100 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Concoctions<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This coppery-tasting substance causes your adrenaline production to spike, granting you a +2 alchemical bonus on melee damage rolls with natural and manufactured weapons.

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":20,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceFlamingSumac","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Food/Drink"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":6900000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/bowl-liquid-red.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"EbRQiAowuUIxIUbr","name":"Spice,  Golden Cardamom","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Spices</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Guide pg. 14</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 15 gp Black cumin, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 20 gp Flaming sumac, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 30 gp Golden cardamom, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 100 gp Striped nutmeg, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 15 gp Sunrise cinnamon, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 25 gp Tiger cloves, <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 5 gp Violet salt; <strong>Weight</strong> - Black cumin, - Flaming sumac, - Golden cardamom, - Striped nutmeg, - Sunrise cinnamon, - Tiger cloves, - Violet salt<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>Food spoils more quickly in hot climates, and Qadirans have become experts at using the spices that they trade to help preserve their meals.

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten.

When exposed to a sudden influx of air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a -4 penalty on Fly checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls.

The sandals are waterproof and are thus popular among individuals who tread the harsh locales of the swamps and wastelands beyond Cassomir proper-especially those who are in such environments for long periods of time without access to the comforts of a skilled cobbler. The sandals' design also allows the wearer to move through shallow bogs normally and to treat deep bogs as if they were shallow bogs (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 427). The sandals do not affect the penalty on Acrobatics checks while in bogs, and creatures wearing the sandals cannot gain cover from deep bogs.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":250,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bogwalkingSandals","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"clothing","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"feet","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/equipment/feet/boots-leather-banded-furred.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"LwlFrBiXvhBU8wFb","name":"Brooch","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Brooch</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 89</em><br/><strong>Price</strong>  Varies; <strong>Weight</strong>  -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Clothing<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This is a small ornament used to hold an element of clothing, such as a cloak or cape, in place.

Each warrior must earn his or her litchina in battle, and most Kara would sooner fight naked than go without theirs.<br/><br/> To be worn properly, a litchina must be attached to a helm or headpiece of some sort (usually via small hooks).

The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters of the appropriate type. The mask negates the -2 Disguise DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask may be able to pass as an orc child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at best looks like a deformed hobgoblin).","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"maskMonster","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"clothing","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"mask","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":4300000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/equipment/head/mask-carved-gargoyle-grey.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"3l3h1ijq4sd2Zfx2","name":"Mask, Signifier","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Signifier mask</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Guide pg. 97</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 75 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Clothing<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>The menacing, eyeless masks of the Hellknight signifers were first created by members of the Order of the Gate, and are semitransparent when viewed from the inside.

When wearing a signifer mask, the wearer is always treated as averting her gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against vision-based effects. However, the obscuring nature of the mask means that the wearer also takes a -4 penalty on vision-based Perception checks while wearing the mask, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).<br/><br/> A character with the Hellknight signifer prestige class can see through the mask as normal, but she can also adjust her mask as a standard action to function as detailed above. Signifer masks are often magically enhanced, becoming variants of items that take up the head item slot.

It has only a few moving joints, and the position of its fingers and wrist must be adjusted and locked into place before the wielder can properly slip it over her arm. When wearing a metal glove, it is impossible to manipulate one's digits (meaning the wearer cannot hold anything in that hand), but that hand and forearm are completely protected from injury, making it easy to reach into a trapped hole or a deadly animal's cage. Any trap or creature attempting to damage an arm wearing a metal glove must break through the glove before reaching the wearer. Heavy objects that would normally crush the wearer's hand rest harmlessly on the glove instead, likely trapping the item but allowing her to pull her hand out as normal. A metal glove has hardness 10 and 15 hit points, and can withstand 2,000 pounds of pressure before crumpling.

Anderos salve is a gray paste applied to the arms or chest that helps restore youthful vigor, while mulibrous tincture is a bitter, minty tea that eases pain and softens skin.

Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"antivenom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Remedies"]]},"consumableType":"potion","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":1200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"m7C12Qz0ZD04fyxL","name":"Applecheek","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Applecheek</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Guide pg. 44</em>, <em>Pathfinder #106: For Queen and Empire pg. 75</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Remedies<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This sticky-sweet syrup is distilled from ivy and rabbit musk, and causes a mild allergic reaction in halflings.

It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.<br/><br/> Any creature with the water affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks elemental brine finds her innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a sorcerer with the elemental (water) bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the creature is a cleric with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.<br/><br/> Creatures with the aquatic subtype that imbibe elemental brine become immune to poison, although poisons active when the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater, it also becomes undetectable by scent for the same duration. Both of these effects last 24 hours.<br/><br/> Finally, elemental brine can be used as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a bottle of elemental brine is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition, a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay between elemental brine's salt and water and the creature's flames, making the target more conductive and thus more susceptible to electrocution.

A direct hit from a fiery boulder deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 5 points of fire damage to every creature affected by its splash damage. All creatures affected by a fiery boulder's direct damage take an additional 2d6 points of fire damage the following round; affected creatures can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Splash Weapon</h2>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 30","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["2d6","fire"],["",""]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":0},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"fieryBoulder","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Weapons"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":2800000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/stone/ore-chunk-red.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"9t8BMe40rdTCSBOK","name":"Firework (banshee ballerina)","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Firework (banshee ballerina)</h1><b>Source</b> <i>Ultimate Equipment pg. 107</i><br/><b>Price</b> 75 gp; <b>Weight</b> -<br/><b>Category</b> Alchemical Weapons<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This small firework burns brightly and makes a loud, eerie whistling sound.

Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 35","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":25,"price":150,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["",""],["",""]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":0},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"fort","description":""},"effectNotes":"see text","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"noxiousPig","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Weapons"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":6200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-3.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"jZZJLdKgRszJrj9t","name":"Pellet grenade (adamantine)","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Pellet grenade</h1><b>Source</b> <i>Ultimate Equipment pg. 107</i><br/><b>Price</b> <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>  150 gp (adamantine), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>  100 gp (cold iron), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>  50 gp (iron), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>  70 gp (silver); <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.

Perfect ice is an alchemically engineered form of water that briefly converts any moisture it touches into a similar state. When a flask of perfect ice is opened or broken (such as by being thrown as a splash weapon), the snowflake within expands rapidly, forming a layer of ice and snow with a 60-foot radius along any nearby surface. Any living creature that touches an area of perfect ice or starts its turn in a space of perfect ice takes 4d6 points of damage from desiccation as some of the water in its body crystallizes (Fortitude DC 18 half).

The application of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.<br/><br/> The most common disease refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.<br/><br/> A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.

Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":5,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"weaponBlanchSilver","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":9600000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/laboratory/bowl-liquid-pink-yellow-green.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"HKDL1h1ZMPqwxvrw","name":"Antidote","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Antidote</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 50</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> varies; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Remedies<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>Generally stored in a glass vial, an antidote is formulated to counteract a specific poison chosen at the time of the antidote's creation.

Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"antivenom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Remedies"]]},"consumableType":"potion","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":10000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

A medium wagon can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo and requires four Medium or two Large creatures to pull it.<br/><br/> <em>Heavy Wagon</em>: Wagons of this type are large, fourwheeled vehicles primarily used in caravans to transport goods over long stretches of territory. A heavy wagon carries up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, and is pulled by either eight Medium creatures or four Large creatures.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0.02,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Passage, Wagon (medium)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"passageWagonMedium","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Transport, Land"]]},"subType":"misc","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":2000000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/wheel.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"qFIlN4JpNRDYHrpz","name":"Passage, Warship","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Warship</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 87</em>, <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 159</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 25,000 gp; <strong>Price of Passage (per mile)</strong> 2 sp<br/><strong>Category</strong> Transport, Sea<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it.

class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This training contraption consists of a stout, 7-foot-tall wooden pillar with spring-powered woodand- brass arms jutting sideways at different heights. When the springs are wound, the arms wave erratically through the area within 10 feet of the pillar. The arms don't swing with sufficient force to cause damage, but you can practice your acrobatic technique by moving up to and around the pillar while the arms are in motion, attempting to avoid being tagged.

This deals only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.<br/><br/> Filling an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) or Sleight of Hand check to avoid spilling the alchemical item on yourself.

The sturdy container features a padded interior with numerous straps and compartments so that the items within aren't damaged in transport. The altar's surface prominently features a deity's holy symbol, and it's sturdy enough that it can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift pulpit.<br/><br/> Among the items found within the altar are the tools and materials necessary to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and professions the related deity deems sacred, as well as holy texts written to inspire greatness in the deity's followers. The user can expend some of the materials within the altar to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Craft check of the specified type (see below).<br/><br/> In addition, after spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within the altar, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus applies (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour of praying and reading the altar's scriptures or lose the bonus-the mantras and inspiration provided by the texts having drifted from her mind. This hour of prayer and scripture reading can be integrated with the time a cleric uses to prepare her spells.

additionally allows for a hidden <em>portable hole</em> (price not included above) secreted within in it. The <em>portable hole</em> rests upon the surface of the wagon bed, with a second layer of wooden planks laid atop it and fastened into place with nuts and bolts so they appear to be a normal part of the wagon. Thus the <em>portable hole</em> sits between the layers of wood like a thin cut of meat between two slices of bread. Those who know about the <em>portable hole</em> can fill it with illicit goods and then fasten the second layer of decking in place and load normal cargo atop it. The wagon weighs no more than it should. This setup allows for the transport of live cargo (rendered suitably silent or unconscious, if necessary), as the planks atop the opening of the portable hole are spaced just far enough apart to allow in breathable air, if the smugglers leave the hole open and attached. Unless someone knows what to look for, a successful DC 30 Perception check is necessary to discover the hidden second layer.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":1000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Vehicle, Caravan master's wagon","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"vehicleCaravanMastersWagon","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Transport, Land"]]},"subType":"misc","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/wood/wood-wheel-brown.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"n6LI2kDeSHZMO54r","name":"Vehicle, Carriage","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Carriage</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 87</em>, <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 159</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 100 gp; <strong>Price of Passage (per mile)</strong> 3 cp<br/><strong>Category</strong> Transport, Land<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers.

<strong>Weight</strong> 10 lbs.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Black Market<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>The Bamboo Palace is a bonsai group planting of bamboo that has been shaped to resemble Hwanggot's royal palace in Haseoung. The bonsai is nonmagical, but in its pristine state is a magnificent representation of the art of bonsai. Though the planting is regrettably overgrown, the frame of a brilliant bonsai is still visible to those familiar with the art form. Beneath the shaggy foliage, one can see that the stems part and interweave again to form windows and doors, and the side branches gracefully curve out to mimic tiered roofs. The bonsai sits in a graceful celadon-glazed pot engraved with the seal of the Yeon dynasty.<br/><br/> The Bamboo Palace's price reflects its current neglected state mixed with its aesthetic potential. If an experienced bonsai gardener tends to it once a week for 1 year, the Bamboo Palace reassumes its earlier manicured form, and its value to a collector increases to 8,000 gp. Restoring it requires successful DC 15 Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (engineering) checks each week during that time.<br/><br/> If the Bamboo Palace is restored to its full glory, a character who spends 15 minutes tending to it and succeeds at DC 20 Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (engineering) checks gains the favor of Upaskuma, the fukujin kami (<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #52</em> 84) who lives within the bonsai. For 24 hours, whenever the favored character begins a round within 15 feet of the Bamboo Palace, the kami's aura of luck grants the character a +2 luck bonus on all skill checks. Only one character can gain this favor each day.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":1000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Bamboo palace","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"bambooPalace","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Black Market"]]},"subType":"tradeGoods","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"modules/pf-content/icons/items/trade-goods/herbalism/herb249.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"0i1thbd5LgcQo8vx","name":"Gaspodar's signet","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Gaspodar's signet</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Lost Treasures pg. 32</em><br /><strong>Price</strong> 5,900 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br /><strong>Category</strong> Black Market</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>\n<p>Gaspodar's signet ring still encircles the severed finger of this long-dead king of Cheliax.

Inserted into a corpse's heart, lungs, and other organs, the needles can be well hidden inside a slain body with a minute of work and a Sleight of Hand check-the result of this Sleight of Hand check determines the Heal check DC to notice the use of quieting needles on a corpse.

This grisly fate can even strike someone brought back to life via <em>resurrection</em> or <em>true resurrection</em> if the body itself was intact and the needles were thus hidden. (Casting <em>resurrection</em> or <em>true resurrection</em> with only a fragment of the body or no body, forcing the spell to rebuild the body as appropriate, is a surefire way to avoid having the victim come back to life with the needles still inside him.)<br/><br/>A creature brought back to life with quieting needles inside him is immediately struck with pain and must make a DC 25 Fortitude save each round to avoid being nauseated from the pain and suffering 1d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the nauseated condition and reduces the Constitution damage to 1.<br/><br/>Removing quieting needles from a dead body takes 1d6+6 rounds (and a DC 20 Heal check if the process is to leave the body in a condition where <em>raise dead</em> is still viable). Removing quieting needles from a freshly restored living body causes 2d6 points of damage per round the procedure continues, with a successful DC 25 Heal check reducing damage caused that round to 2.<br/><br/>The use of quieting needles is relatively uncommon, meant as much to punish enemies for attempting to raise dead allies and force them to waste the resources on such expensive magic as well as to cause the restored creature agonizing pain-using quieting needles is an evil act that is as illegal as murder in most civilized regions.<br/><br/>A set of quieting needles costs 25 gp.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":25,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Quieting needles","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"quietingNeedles","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Black Market"]]},"subType":"tradeGoods","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":1000000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/fasteners/pin-spiked.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"tAb9NmTjDkqLbHpw","name":"Slave","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Slave</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Armory pg. 19</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 75 gp , <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 100 gp (hard labor), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 50 gp (household), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 100 gp (slip, halfling), <img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> 500 gp (specialized); <strong>Weight</strong> 175 lbs. , 200 lbs.

When loaded with a splash weapon or a vial of poison (contact or inhaled poisons only) and armed as a full-round action, an angry jack attacks the next creature to open the box, using its spring-loaded interior to launch that item at the target as a ranged touch attack (attack bonus +0). A creature struck by a contact poison in this way is exposed to the poison as normal, but a creature is automatically exposed to a loaded inhalation poison with no attack roll needed. Identifying an angry jack requires a successful a DC 20 Perception check. A character who is trained in the Disable Device skill can spend 10 minutes disguising an armed angry jack, allowing her to roll a Disable Device check and use the result as the Perception DC for others to detect the true nature of the angry jack.

Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table 1-1: Armor and Shields.<br/><br/> Armor for a horse (a Large non-humanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see Table 1-2: Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the price is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.<br/><br/> Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.<br/><br/> Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table 1-3: Donning Armor.

This price assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question, though you may be lucky enough to find someone who has it prepared that day or a spontaneous caster who knows it). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell (for example, to cast <em>dispel magic </em>on a magical seal in a dungeon) you need to negotiate with her; the default answer to such requests is typically no, since most people don't actually like to go on unexpected life-threatening adventures.<br/><br/> The price given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.<br/><br/> If a spell has dangerous consequences (such as <em>contact other plane</em>, which has a risk of decreasing the caster's Intelligence and Charisma), the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). If these additional costs put the total spellcasting price above 3,000 gp, the spell is not generally available.<br/><br/> In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell (one for the caster to take you there and one for the caster to return), even if you aren't returning with the caster.<br/><br/> Not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4thlevel spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Service, Spellcasting","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"serviceSpellcasting","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Lodging/Services"]]},"subType":"tradeGoods","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"sort":2900000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/environment/people/cleric-orange.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"dmvRvlO4CbqsxgbR","name":"Service, Valet","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/> Valet</h1><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 99</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Lodging/Services<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This title includes valets, butlers, lady's maids, ladies-inwaiting, secretaries, stewards, concierges, majordomos, manservants, bodyservants, and other skilled, trusted servants and employees who work closely with an employer or run a household or business, sometimes without direct supervision.
