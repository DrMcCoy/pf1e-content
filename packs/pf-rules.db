It is important to note that these racial traits are not the same as the trait rules. Those traits are effectively half-feats, intended to tie characters to the specific nations, cultures, regions, and races of the Golarion campaign world. Racial traits, on the other hand, are those racial abilities described at the bottom of each race&rsquo;s descriptive page. Some races have few racial traits, like half-orcs and humans. Others, like dwarves and gnomes, have many. All of these racial traits represent typical members of the race and the kinds of special abilities they gain from their heritage, whether from biology, racial attitudes, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This chapter also contains a list of alternate class features for each race. Some of them play on racial archetypes not ref lected in the standard racial traits, like a gnome&rsquo;s love of languages or tinkering or a half ling&rsquo;s mastery of thrown items or of slipping through a battlefield under the feet of larger races. In order to choose one of these racial traits, you must exchange one or more of the existing racial traits available to your character. These racial traits replace a character&rsquo;s normal racial traits; they are not abilities gained in addition to them. In many cases, racial abilities are exchanged on a one-to-one basis; you give up one racial ability from the Core Rulebook to gain one presented in this book. In other cases, you may have to exchange more than one racial trait to take one of these alternate racial traits. For example, a gnome may eschew the militant path and exchange defensive training and hatred for the gift of tongues, while other magic-using gnomes might forgo the traditional gnome specialty of illusion magic to become a magical linguist or even a pyromaniac.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can exchange one or several of your character&rsquo;s normal racial traits, but of course you cannot exchange the same racial trait more than once. If a human exchanges the skilled trait to become either a child of the fields or a child of the street, she cannot exchange it twice to take both new traits. However, she could choose one of those as an alternate racial trait while also exchanging her bonus feat racial trait to gain an eye for talent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with any alternate or optional rule, you must first get the permission of your GM to exchange any of your character&rsquo;s normal racial traits for those in this chapter.</p>","_id":"0x0YFcja3MTuO9Ep"}

Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player&rsquo;s choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, the following pages explore new rules, options, and alternate class features for each core class.</p>\n<p>So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players&rsquo; freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>Most of the options presented on the following pages include a host of alternate class features. When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found in the Core Rulebook or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them&mdash;often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options.</p>\n<p>All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.<br /><br />A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.</p>\n<h2>Adapting Existing Characters</h2>\n<p>Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn&rsquo;t be gaining any special advantage over other party members.</p>\n<p>As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.<br /><br />While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn&rsquo;t have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn&rsquo;t feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment.</p>\n<p>Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what&rsquo;s best for the campaign.</p>","_id":"Cc1oVNDZuo9OrnbO"}

Character Backgrounds","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3oxzrp4gebj","path":"Rules#/CF_SEP/Basics","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>A character background details the significant events, people, and life experiences that make up the origin story of a character prior to his or her role in the saga of a campaign. Some characters are born under extraordinary circumstances, heralded by prophecy and omen; others live completely ordinary lives until some dramatic event casts them onto the dangerous roads traveled by heroes and monsters.</p>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s background forms the basis for complex motivations and emotional vulnerabilities, and these past experiences guide the way the character responds to circumstances in his or her present life. As the child of a goddess and a mortal, do you view ordinary creatures as inferior beings? Having grown up in abject poverty, how do you react when someone steals from you? If a militant theocracy burned your siblings as heretics, how do you respond to clerics of other religions?</p>\n<p>When playing a new character, the details in your background give you a quick handle on your past, making it easier to slip into the character&rsquo;s skin and embrace this mind-set in play. As the campaign proceeds, your early adventures gradually become part of that background&mdash;a seamless chain of events that make up your life and contribute to your constantly changing and evolving persona.</p>\n<h2>How to Create a Background</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>There are several ways you can approach character background using Ultimate Campaign. One approach is an organic method&mdash;brainstorming character details, guided by the questions in the following sections of this chapter. Alternatively, you might use the background generator, to compile your history randomly. You can also use the charts and tables in the background generator as a springboard for your imagination, deliberately selecting background elements that inspire you or fit the direction you wish to explore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For published Pathfinder Adventure Paths, you often have the option of selecting campaign traits that tie your character thematically into a specific storyline relevant to that Adventure Path. Check with your GM to see if she can point you to official campaign traits or other traits that may help link your character to the campaign or adventure she&rsquo;s running. Such traits provide a good foundation upon which you can add details from this book, either by rolling randomly or by manually selecting background details that mesh well with your campaign&rsquo;s themes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No matter how you go about developing your character&rsquo;s background, the next step is to quantify that background in terms of game mechanics. Select two traits (or three traits and a drawback) that capture the background you imagined. Traits and drawbacks are listed here. These traits provide small bonuses that reflect skills and knowledge gained from your life experiences. The drawback, if you choose to take one, represents an emotional vulnerability or character flaw that should not only provide a slight mechanical disadvantage, but also (more importantly) serve as a roleplaying tool for making interesting choices. After all, nobody&rsquo;s perfect!</p>\n<h2>Using this Section</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>The rest of this section dives deep into your background, starting from birth and early childhood through adolescence and into early adulthood. Each bit has a number of questions to think (or write) about. As you go through them, you might find a question doesn&rsquo;t apply you. That&rsquo;s an opportunity to instead think about why it doesn&rsquo;t apply, and what that means about your relationship to the rest of the world. Likewise, if you find you have a short answer to a question, especially &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s an opportunity to dig deeper into why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Above all, don&rsquo;t let creating a background become a burden for you. The goal is to help you play a character, not to paralyze you with decisions you don&rsquo;t want to make right now.</p>\n<h2>Early Life</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>Experiences in childhood have a monumental impact on the person you become later in life. Family, social class, region, family trade or profession, religion, culture, and major events that occur during your life have a formative influence on your character development and the worldview that you adopt as an adult.</p>\n<p>As you think about your early life, consider the following questions and imagine your roots in a time long before you gained the knack for the character class you have chosen&mdash;after all, almost nobody starts life with their future profession already laid out for them. This information will influence your choice of skills, traits, story feats, and penalties, and help to ground you in the campaign world.</p>\n<h2>Adolescence</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 12</em></p>\n<p>Adolescence is the physical and psychological transition from childhood to adulthood in which you start to become more conscious of the world around you. This is the time when you grow in body and mind, take greater risks, question the rules and structures under which you&rsquo;ve lived, and test the boundaries and authorities that put those structures in place. It&rsquo;s also when many key events happen that influence you toward the path of the character class you will one day adopt.</p>\n<p>Now that you know something of your childhood circumstances, imagine the kinds of risks and choices you might have taken upon entering adolescence. Conversely, imagine the kinds of risks and choices you would avoid because of ethics, family, customs, tradition, religion, pride, or fear. As you read through the following categories, consider the questions and take some time to visualize the experiences you encountered during this turbulent time.</p>\n<h2>Adulthood</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 13</em></p>\n<p>When you reach biological maturity, undergo the final initiation rites of adolescence, or reach the age of legal responsibility in your culture, you&rsquo;re considered an adult. At this point, you&rsquo;re the sum of all the feelings, experiences, and choices you have made from birth through adolescence. You are capable of analyzing your past, and your emotional and intellectual response to your experiences shapes your moral and ethical view of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In adulthood, you likely adopt your character class&mdash; although some people might assume full careers in the military, academia, the seminary, or a trade years before they begin adventuring, just as others pass through adolescence swiftly and reach maturity at an extremely young age. Playing an older or younger character can vary the party dynamic, and may warrant one extra or one fewer trait during character creation in order to reflect the character&rsquo;s greater or narrower life experience, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. (See Young Characters) No matter your age, the experiences of your earlier life are a prologue to the character class you&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following categories explore character conflicts and vulnerability that shape your worldview, philosophy, and alignment&mdash;the results of your journey to adulthood. As you read through this section, consider the amount of life experience you have upon entering the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Two Quirks and a Flaw: Quick and Dirty Character Establishement</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 15</em></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re pressed for time or you&rsquo;re looking to create the basics of a character as simply as possible, establish the essence of your personality by thinking of two quirks and a flaw. Quirks are specific attributes of your personality or psyche: character traits, compulsions, eccentricities, or uncommon physical features.</p>\n<p>These shouldn&rsquo;t be commonplace or mundane. &ldquo;Tall&rdquo; is a poor one, but &ldquo;too big for my body&rdquo; could be great. &ldquo;Charismatic&rdquo; is weak, but &ldquo;flirts with nearly everybody I meet&rdquo; is specific and actionable. &ldquo;Homebody&rdquo; is not as good a quirk as &ldquo;feels tired, uncomfortable, and hungry away from home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Add a flaw the same way. Instead of merely being &ldquo;arrogant,&rdquo; maybe you &ldquo;believe I&rsquo;m smarter than anyone I know.&rdquo; Perhaps you&rsquo;re not so much &ldquo;proud&rdquo; as &ldquo;afraid of being wrong and looking stupid.&rdquo; Rather than &ldquo;greedy,&rdquo; you may be &ldquo;terrified of dying poor and hungry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you choose an attribute or trait to use as a quirk or flaw, you can dig deeper into the concept by asking yourself how and why. If you&rsquo;re shy, how shy are you? So shy that you can never look anyone directly in the eye? If you&rsquo;re paranoid, why are you paranoid? Maybe everyone you&rsquo;ve ever trusted betrayed you? Homing in on desires and fears will help answer those questions. For the sake of brevity, the background generator uses basic descriptors for quirks and flaws.</p>\n<p>Take a little time to further build on those bare-bones descriptors with these sort of details, which will help color in an otherwise simple, nondescript character.</p>","_id":"GPnkQ1XErXgnq417"}

How to Play","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3oxzrp4gebj","path":"Rules#/CF_SEP/Basics","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<h1>How to Play</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures. Helping them tell this story is the Game Master (or GM), who decides what threats the player characters (or PCs) face and what sorts of rewards they earn for succeeding at their quest. Think of it as a cooperative storytelling game, where the players play the protagonists and the Game Master acts as the narrator, controlling the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>If you are a player, you make all of the decisions for your character, from what abilities your character has to the type of weapon he carries. Playing a character, however, is more than just following the rules in this book. You also decide your character&rsquo;s personality. Is he a noble knight, set on vanquishing a powerful evil, or is he a conniving rogue who cares more about gold than glory? The choice is up to you.</p>\n<p>If you are a Game Master, you control the world that the players explore. Your job is to bring the setting to life and to present the characters with challenges that are both fair and exciting. From the local merchant prince to the rampaging dragon, you control all of the characters that are not being played by the players. Paizo&rsquo;s Pathfinder Adventure Path series, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder Chronicles world guides provide everything you need to run a game, or you can invent your own, using the rules in this book as well as the monsters found in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What You Need</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to this book, you will need a number of special dice to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dice that come with most board games have six sides, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game uses dice with four sides, six sides, eight sides, ten sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides. Dice of this sort can be found at your local game store or online at paizo.com.</p>\n<p>In addition to dice, if you are a player, you will need a character sheet (which can be photocopied from the back of this book) and, if the Game Master uses a map to represent the adventure, a small figurine to represent your character. These figurines, or miniatures, can also be found at most game stores. They come in a wide variety of styles, so you can probably find a miniature that relatively accurately depicts your character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are the Game Master, you will need a copy of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, which contains the rules for a whole spectrum of monsters, from the mighty dragon to the lowly goblin. While many of these monsters can be used to fight against the players, others might provide useful information or become powerful allies. Some might even join the group, with one of the players taking on the role of a monstrous character. In addition, you should have your own set of dice and some sort of screen you can use to hide your notes, maps, and dice rolls behind. (Although you should be honest about the results of your dice rolls, sometimes the results are not evident, and openly rolling the dice might give away too much information.) Combat in the Pathfinder RPG can be resolved in one of two ways: you can describe the situation to the characters and allow them to interact based on the description you provide, or you can draw the situation on a piece of paper or a specially made battle mat and allow the characters to move their miniatures around to more accurately represent their position during the battle. While both ways have their advantages, if you choose the latter, you will need a mat to draw on, such as Paizo&rsquo;s line of GameMastery Flip-Mats, as well as miniatures to represent the monsters or other adversaries. These can also be found at your local game shop, or at paizo.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Playing the Game</strong></h2>\n<p>While playing the Pathfinder RPG, the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as &ldquo;d#,&rdquo; with the &ldquo;#&rdquo; representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the &ldquo;d.&rdquo; For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or &ndash; after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character&rsquo;s skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a &ldquo;4&rdquo; and the other d10 rolls a &ldquo;2,&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ve generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with &ldquo;10,&rdquo; &ldquo;20,&rdquo; &ldquo;30,&rdquo; and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you must round a number, always round down.</p>\n<p>As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges. While a 1st-level character might be up to saving a farmer&rsquo;s daughter from rampaging goblins, defeating a terrifying red dragon might require the powers of a 20th-level hero. It is the Game Master&rsquo;s duty to provide challenges for your character that are engaging, but not so deadly as to leave you with no hope of success. For more information on the duties of being a Game Master, see Chapter 12.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Above all, have fun. Playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be exciting and rewarding for both the Game Master and the players. Adventure awaits!</p>\n<h1>The Most Important Rule</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>The rules in this book are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of &ldquo;house rules&rdquo; that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the Pathfinder RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt.</p>","_id":"QV8MzSgauYFUkoJC"}

Traits","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3oxzrp4gebj","path":"Rules#/CF_SEP/Basics","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character&rsquo;s race or class. They can enhance your character&rsquo;s skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn&rsquo;t just another kind of power you can add on to your character&mdash;it&rsquo;s a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world.</p>\n<p>Think of character traits as &ldquo;story seeds&rdquo; for your background; after you pick your two traits, you&rsquo;ll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character&rsquo;s personality and history. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;ve already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a &ldquo;trait&rdquo; bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack&mdash;they&rsquo;re intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character&rsquo;s traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It&rsquo;s certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a &ldquo;Courageous&rdquo; trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character traits are only for player characters. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC must &ldquo;buy&rdquo; them with the Additional Traits feat. Player characters are special; they&rsquo;re the stars of the game, after all, and it makes sense that they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way.</p>\n<h2>Gaining Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source </strong><em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what amounts to a bonus feat at character creation.</p>\n<p>Some GMs may wish to adjust this number somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM normally doesn&rsquo;t allow bonus traits, you might still be able to pick up some with the Additional Traits feat.</p>\n<h2>Types of Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>There are five types of character traits to choose from: basic (split among four categories: Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social), campaign, race, regional, and religion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Basic Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a total of 40 basic traits, which are split evenly among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren&rsquo;t tied to specific classes. It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are &ldquo;generic,&rdquo; and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Campaign Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path&rsquo;s Player&rsquo;s Guide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Race Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a reincarnation spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist&mdash;only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Regional Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character&rsquo;s place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character&rsquo;s background.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Religion Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions on Trait Selection.</p>\n<h2>Restrictions on Trait Selection</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>There are a few rules governing trait selection. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits (the four basic traits each count as a separate list for this purpose). Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character&rsquo;s development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the Additional Traits feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he&rsquo;ll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits&mdash;since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions.</p>\n<p>In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait.</p>","_id":"lwq3hUFFBQnso9Hk"}
{"name":"1.1. Common Terms","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3oxzrp4gebj","path":"Rules#/CF_SEP/Basics","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 11</em></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ability Score</strong>: Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature&rsquo;s most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Action</strong>: An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of different kinds of actions, such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action (see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Alignment represents a creature&rsquo;s basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single &ldquo;N.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>: All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus (BAB)</strong>: Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of full-round action&mdash;see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not &ldquo;stack&rdquo;)&mdash;only the greater bonus granted applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level (CL)</strong>: Caster level represents a creature&rsquo;s power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Class</strong>: Classes represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the core classes or prestige classes, since these are the most powerful (see Chapters 3 and 11). Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful (see Chapter 14).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver</strong>: This is an action taken in combat that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him (see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB)</strong>: This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character&rsquo;s d20 roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD)</strong>: This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature&rsquo;s CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration Check</strong>: When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a concentration check or fail to cast the spell (see Chapter 9).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Creature:</strong> A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Reduction (DR)</strong>: Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a &ldquo;/&rdquo; followed by the type, such as &ldquo;10/cold iron.&rdquo; Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted by the &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo; symbol. See Appendix 1 for more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty Class (DC):</strong> Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):</strong> Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Experience Points (XP):</strong> As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Feat</strong>: A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Game Master (GM):</strong> A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM&rsquo;s duty is to provide a fair and fun game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice (HD)</strong>: Hit Dice represent a creature&rsquo;s general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster&rsquo;s general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as &ldquo;3d8.&rdquo; This value is used to determine a creature&rsquo;s total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature&rsquo;s hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points (hp)</strong>: Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature&rsquo;s hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature&rsquo;s hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature&rsquo;s hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initiative</strong>: Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Level:</strong> A character&rsquo;s level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Monster</strong>: Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplying</strong>: When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nonplayer Character (NPC)</strong>: These are characters controlled by the GM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Penalty:</strong> Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Player Character (Character, PC)</strong>: These are the characters portrayed by the players.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Round:</strong> Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Rounding:</strong> Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a saving throw to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw&mdash;they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), Ref lex (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as fireball), and Will (used to resist mental attacks and spells).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skill</strong>: A skill represents a creature&rsquo;s ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell</strong>: Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</strong>: Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Resistance (SR)</strong>: Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature&rsquo;s SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stacking</strong>: Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Supernatural Abilities (Su)</strong>: Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability&rsquo;s description includes information on how it is used and its effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Turn</strong>: In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see Chapter 8 for more details.</p>","_id":"p71F8wHctxANPeE7"}

Character Creation","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3oxzrp4gebj","path":"Rules#/CF_SEP/Basics","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 14</em></p>\n<p>From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the Pathfinder RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character&rsquo;s concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.</p>\n<p>Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your Pathfinder RPG character sheet, which can be found at the back of this book and photocopied for your convenience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 1&mdash; Determine Ability Scores</h2>\n<p>Start by generating your character&rsquo;s ability scores. These six scores determine your character&rsquo;s most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 2&mdash;Pick Your Race</h2>\n<p>Next, pick your character&rsquo;s race, noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits (see Chapter 2). There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 3&mdash;Pick Your Class</h2>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s class represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 4&mdash;Pick Skills and Select Feats</h2>\n<p>Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many feats your character receives, based on his class and level, and select them from those presented in Chapter 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 5&mdash;Buy Equipment</h2>\n<p>Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without the consent of your GM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 6&mdash;Finishing Details</h2>\n<p>Finally, you need to determine all of a character&rsquo;s details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps.</p>\n<p>A level 1 character begins with maximum hit points for its Hit Die roll. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character&rsquo;s name, alignment, and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game. Additional rules (like age and alignment) are described in Chapter 7.</p>","_id":"xKtx6D2i3o5Qvzg9"}
