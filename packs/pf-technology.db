As a swift action, the device can be activated to stimulate the wearer's brain into accelerated activity. For 1 minute, the wearer gains two sets of actions each turn-two move, two standard, and two swift actions-in any order desired. A standard and move action can be combined into a full-round action as normal, but actions with a duration of 1 round still take up the wearer's entire turn. When the duration expires (or the effects ends for any reason), the device deals 2 points of Intelligence and Constitution drain as well as shortens the wearer's maximum lifespan by 5 years as a result of neurological deterioration. This shortened lifespan does not hasten the accumulation of age-related bonuses or penalties; it merely hastens death from old age. While the ability drain caused by the temporal accelerator can be treated with <em>restoration</em> and similar effects, the wearer's shortened lifespan cannot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a temporal accelerator is activated more than once in a 24-hour period, the wearer takes an additional 2d4 points of Constitution and Intelligence damage in addition to the Constitution drain at the end of the device's effect, and loses an additional 10 years of life expectancy instead of 5 for activating the device. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save reduces the ability damage by half. The ability damage increases by 1d4 and the save DC increases by 5 for each activation beyond the second in a 24-hour period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A temporal accelerator can be disarmed or sundered with a disarm or sunder combat maneuver.

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects. A force field can be deactivated as a free action.</p><p></p><p> The charge capacity, amount of temporary hit points granted, and rate of fast healing these temporary hit points have varies according to the force field's color code, as detailed below.</p><p></p><p> <table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Temp HP</strong></td><td><strong>Fast Healing</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>25</td><td>20</td><td>4</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>6</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>45</td><td>40</td><td>8</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>50</td><td>60</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 28 (black), DC 33 (blue), DC 27 (brown), DC 30 (gray), DC 31 (green), DC 34 (orange), DC 35 (prismatic), DC 32 (red), DC 29 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 10,000 gp (black), 60,000 gp (blue), 2,000 gp (brown), 30,000 gp (gray), 40,000 gp (green), 70,000 gp (orange), 110,000 gp (prismatic), 50,000 gp (red), 20,000 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, graviton lab</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":4000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"wrist","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"icons/magic/water/barrier-ice-shield.webp","effects":[],"_id":"1qQIMI5kMyMO0ifj"}

If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p></p><p> A hologram generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities, including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Brown Hologram Generator</strong>: A brown hologram generator can create only a static, motionless image no larger than a Small creature, and can store only one such image.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Black Hologram Generator</strong>: A black hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Medium creature, and can store three images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>White Hologram Generator</strong>: A white hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Large creature, and can store five images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Gray Hologram Generator</strong>: A gray hologram generator functions as a white hologram generator (and can store up to seven images), but can also store up to 1 minute of moving imagery as well. A moving hologram can move anywhere in range of the generator (see table on next page), as long as the user continues to take a move action each round to aim and direct the motion. An unattended generator's hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that area.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Green Hologram Generator</strong>: A green hologram generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image. It can store up to nine images or 2 minutes of moving imagery. It can store images equal in size to a Huge or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Red Hologram Generator</strong>: A red hologram generator functions as a green one, except that it can create two images within range simultaneously. Directing these images is a free action. A red hologram generator can store up to 11 images or 3 minutes of moving imagery.

In addition, it can store images equal in size to a Gargantuan or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prismatic Hologram Generator</strong>: A prismatic hologram generator functions as an orange one. As long as only one image is created, the image is further enhanced by graviton fields, which give it the ability to interact with the environment. (Such images still last for only 4 minutes.) A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score. On a successful hit, the hologram deals 2d6+6 points of force damage, regardless of the hologram's size.</p><p></p><p> <table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Range</strong></td><td><strong>Will</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>100 ft.</td><td>DC 11</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>20</td><td>200 ft.</td><td>DC 13</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>30</td><td>300 ft.</td><td>DC 14</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>40</td><td>400 ft.</td><td>DC 16</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>50</td><td>500 ft.</td><td>DC 17</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>60</td><td>600 ft.</td><td>DC 19</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>70</td><td>700 ft.</td><td>DC 20</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>80</td><td>800 ft.</td><td>DC 22</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>90</td><td>900 ft.</td><td>DC 23</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 27 (black), DC 32 (blue), DC 26 (brown), DC 29 (gray), DC 30 (green), DC 33 (orange), DC 34 (prismatic), DC 31 (red), DC 28 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 500 gp (black), 25,000 gp (blue), 250 gp (brown), 2,000 gp (gray), 15,000 gp (green), 30,000 gp (orange), 45,000 gp (prismatic), 20,000 gp (red), 1,000 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab (prismatic hologram generator requires a graviton lab)</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":50000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":70,"max":70,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"2qdqIVC4vjJfxV7L"}

Soothe's side effect of transforming wounds into raw, ugly scar tissue tends to make those who abuse the drug-like pharmaceutical increasingly into hideous monstrosities over time.

The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat (see page 7) succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the cortex gun's programming was scrambled, the nanites die without doing any harm or aid to the target.</p><p></p><p> If the cortex gun was properly programmed to one of the six ability scores, the nanites swiftly disperse through the user's body, enhancing and augmenting that ability score over the course of several days. These augmentations are inherent bonuses, and increase the ability score by 1 every 24 hours that pass until the cortex gun's maximum bonus is reached.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun can only function on living corporeal creatures, but a living creature with a bonus granted by a cortex gun that dies and becomes undead retains that bonus in undeath.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun can only be used once before it becomes useless.

On the primary setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect determined by its color-these effects mimic specific restorative spells as indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound ability can be healed).</p><p></p><p> A nanite hypogun functions only on a living, corporeal creature.

A rebirthing chamber cannot operate on its own power, and must be attached to an external power source. When a Small or Medium humanoid lies within a rebirthing chamber, the chamber automatically seals. Soporific gas fills the chamber, inducing a deathlike coma (Fortitude DC 30 each round negates; this is a poison effect). One minute after it seals, the chamber floods with nanites that first analyze, then reduce the occupant to its component molecules. The dismantling process deals 6d10 points of damage and 1d4 point of Constitution drain each round (Fortitude DC 30 half), a horrifically painful process should the occupant retain consciousness. Any gear worn by the occupant is dismantled and destroyed, with possibly catastrophic results for explosives and powered devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the next 1d4 days, the nanites reconstruct and enhance the occupant, in effect optimizing its genetic code. The occupant wakes up with full memories of its prior existence, but in the body of a young adult of its race, halfway between the minimum and maximum age of its current age category. In the process, all ability scores receive a +2 inherent bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each time a rebirthing chamber is used, there is a 10% chance its nanite reconstruction fails, leaving the host dead and without remains. Only a <em>miracle</em>, <em>true resurrection</em>, or <em>wish</em> can restore such a hapless victim. The nanite reservoir contains sufficient nanites for five rebirths, assuming it hasn't been previously used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A rebirthing chamber only works on humanoids and humanoid corporeal undead. It can even restore life to a long-dead corpse, so long as usable genetic information remains, but with a 25% chance of failure instead of 10%. For each day that passed without preservation such as <em>gentle repose</em>, the revived creature loses roughly 10% of its memories and gains 1 permanent negative level. If the negative levels gained exceed the creature's level, the revival fails. Intelligent corporeal undead retain their memories after revival, but lose all undead abilities and regain their original statistics and abilities from their time among the living. Effects that restore these negative levels also restore these lost memories.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attempts to rebirth a creature without a soul invariably fail, as do attempts to rebirth a creature from partial remains while the creature is still alive. A body is created and draws breath, but lacks any intellect and dies 2d6 hours after the process completed.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1200,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Rebirthing Chamber","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/tube-chamber-lightning.webp","effects":[]}

One of the narrow ends of the device features a small touch-sensitive panel and several sockets to connect to external devices as needed, although the compact AI core can communicate with most electronic devices and robots wirelessly at a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary purpose of a compact AI core is to house the staggering amount of data needed to store an artificial intelligence without compromising or degrading its core programming. Most processors capable of storing this amount of data are significant in size, but a compact AI core is small enough to carry in one hand. An AI stored within a compact AI core loses all implicit connections to the source AI. An existing AI can copy itself into a compact AI, but once the copy is complete the new AI within the compact AI core becomes a duplicate but separate entity that may develop different needs and desires than the source. As a result, many AIs resist the idea of duplicating themselves in such a manner so as to avoid possible conflicts or competition. An AI faced with the certain destruction of its core processors, of course, may well resort to using a compact AI core as a method of escape and survival, but the unpredictable changes to personality that are possible during such a transfer may well prompt some AIs to gracefully accept oblivion instead. In a way, it's better to view the relationship between an AI and its duplicate in a compact AI core as more akin to that of parent and child than as twin siblings or clones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More often, a compact AI core is used to house an entirely new AI creation, either one programmed from scratch (a discipline lost to the denizens of <em>Divinity</em> today, and one that was thus never available to the inhabitants of Golarion), or one created by the transfer of a living creature's mind via neurocam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An AI can use a compact AI core to seize control of a robot to transform it into an aggregate (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</em> 59), but no more often than one robot can be controlled at a time, and the compact AI core must remain within 60 feet of the aggregate or control is lost. An AI who attempts to seize control of a robot in this manner can do so as a standard action, and the target can resist the attempt with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the AI's CR + its Charisma modifier).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A compact AI core has 3 sockets capable of accepting one memory facet each. A compact AI core consumes power at the rate of 1 charge per hour, but does not suffer any memory loss or damage if all 240 charges stored within it are consumed-once the compact AI core receives more energy, the AI within immediately regains the ability to interact with the world. While without power, an AI becomes dormant-it may experience something akin to strange dreams, but it cannot be communicated with and is not aware of the passage of time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A compact AI core has hardness 20 and 80 hit points. If a compact AI core becomes broken, the AI it contains takes a �2 penalty on all saving throws and skill checks. If a compact AI core is destroyed, any AI housed within is destroyed as well. A compact AI core that is destroyed can be repaired via a <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em>, or perhaps via complex technological machinery hidden deep in the most secure of <em>Divinity's</em> wreckage-but restoring an AI previously housed in the core to functionality requires a second <em>miracle</em> or <em>wish</em>-such an act is beyond even the machinery of Divinity.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":8,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Compact AI Core (Iron Gods)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":240,"max":240,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf-content.pf-tech.8HOoYnjr7VMRBIv5"}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/bearing-steel-green.webp","effects":[]}

Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams). The user of a force field can still breathe, but she cannot eat or drink.</p><p></p><p> Activating a force field is a standard action that consumes 1 charge, after which point the field consumes 1 additional charge every minute it remains active. While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects.

The crystal's interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering amount of programming-these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and at the time <em>Divinity </em>began its mission, they were primarily used for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal's connectors into an appropriate slot in an AI's core processor or a robot under the AI's control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and processors it controls-where a memory facet is installed makes little difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in their most secure locations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each memory facet contains a unique combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence's capabilities. In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created-items intended to disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI's personality or even its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI's code. Once installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Listed below are rules for the memory facets in this adventure-future adventures will contain rules for other types of memory facets, and in the final adventure, the PCs can use their collected facets not only to fight against Unity, but also to augment and enhance their own AI ally, the oracle Casandalee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Aggression Facet</strong>: This memory facet enhances an AI's offensive protocols, imparting a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and granting Deadly Aim and Power Attack as bonus feats when the AI is controlling a robot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ego Facet</strong>: An ego facet bolsters an AI's sense of selfesteem and sense of worth, imparting a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws and a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks, as well as granting Toughness as a bonus feat when the AI is controlling a robot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor Facet</strong>: An inhibitor facet is unusual among memory facets in that it isn't intended to augment an AI at all, but rather to hinder and impair its functionality. When installed, an inhibitor facet reduces an AI's Charisma by 4 and imposes a �4 penalty on all skill checks, saving throws, initiative checks, and attack rolls. The effects of multiple inhibitor facets do not stack.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Memory Facet (Aggression, Ego, Inhibitor) (Iron Gods)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/metal-panel.webp","effects":[]}

Before being thrown by hand, the grenade must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with a click of a button at the center of that dial. Priming and arming a grenade is a free action; a grenade launcher primes and arms all grenades it fires. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder's next turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a grenade detonates, it damages all targets within a 20-footradius spread.

It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

It is contained within a series of circular arms of tempered adamantine-difficult to damage to begin with, but while the drive is infused with Unity's divine power, the entire structure is essentially indestructible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Divinity Drive's primary purpose was to create wormholes in space that would allow for swift travel over vast distances. Programming the Divinity Drive to open a wormhole can be accomplished only outside of significant gravitational fields-in high orbit around a planet or further out in space. A successful DC 25 Knowledge (engineering) check is required to program the wormhole's destination, a process which takes 2d6 days to complete. Every 5 points by which the check exceeds this DC reduces the number of days required by 1 (minimum 1). A wormhole can be torn open as an act of desperation in only 2d6 minutes with the same Knowledge (engineering) DC, but doing so causes the wormhole to open to a random point elsewhere in the Material Plane, and it damages the drive's wormhole function-which requires a large team of engineers or a dedicated AI to repair, and takes several years to complete.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When created, the wormhole connects two points on the Material Plane, as if by <em>gate</em>. The wormhole measures 1 mile in diameter, and remains open for 24 hours (or until the Divinity Drive moves more than 100 miles away from the wormhole). It can be closed manually before this time expires with a successful DC 40 Knowledge (engineering) check. Any object not yet clear of the wormhole when it closes is cut into two parts separated by a vast distance (which generally results in death or destruction), though a creature can avoid this by succeeding at a DC 20 Reflex save to throw itself into one side or the other before the wormhole closes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In time, Unity found another use for the Divinity Drive-the transformation of a virtual reality into a stable divine realm housed entirely within the code of Divinity's computer system. Today, the Divinity Drive functions as the linchpin for Unity's realm; as long as Unity exists, its realm and the Divinity Drive shall persist in this invulnerable state.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Divinity Drive has other astonishing effects as well as long as it functions, as summarized below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All teleportation and extradimensional travel within Silver Mount (or within a 1-mile radius if the Divinity Drive is removed from Silver Mount) is suppressed, as if by a <em>dimensional lock</em> effect. A few teleportation effects (such as the teleporter between areas <strong>A15</strong> and <strong>G6</strong>, and travel to and from the Godmind in area <strong>G5</strong>) are exempt from this. A successful DC 30 Knowledge (engineering) check allows someone who examines the Divinity Drive for 1d6 minutes to deactivate this effect, allowing teleportation to function normally, but the drive cannot be used to open wormholes while this effect is inactive.</li>\n<li>The Divinity Drive is a staggering source of power, and functions as a generator with infinite yield.</li>\n<li>The area in a 50-foot-radius spread around the Divinity Drive is maintained at a constant temperature of extreme cold, and it actively leeches sources of heat from unshielded or unprotected sources. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 points of cold damage per round, and casting a spell with the fire descriptor requires a successful DC 25 caster level check to avoid having the spell automatically countered as its cast. Technological items that generate fire effects function normally in this area, but all existing fires are extinguished at the end of the round. Creatures with the fire subtype take 6d6 points of cold damage per round in this region (Fortitude DC 25 negates for that round).</li>\n<li>The Divinity Drive emits a constant, thunderous hum that imposes a �10 penalty on all Perception checks made within a 50-foot-radius spread.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Destruction</h3>\n<p>If Unity is destroyed, the aura that protects the Divinity Drive fails. It can then be destroyed as a normal item (hardness 20, hp 1,200), which causes it to explode as if a graviton reactor<sup>TG</sup>, but with twice as much damage and double the radius.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":2500,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Divinity Drive (Iron Gods)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/dial-meter-gauge-blue.webp","effects":[]}

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks).

Every power generator<sup>TG</sup> has a built-in power transmitter that allows for the transmission of power to a nearby power receiver<sup>TG</sup>, but an external power relay is required to send this energy beyond the generator's limitations. A power relay consumes 10 charges when it is activated (this is a full-round action), after which it automatically links to the closest generator within 1,000 feet that has an available yield. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. (The power relay in \"Fires of Creation\" is just barely in range of the engineering deck reactor as a result.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The power relay consumes 1 charge of the generator's available yield per hour to maintain its own power supplies, and can be programmed to transmit any remaining charges of available yield to any object capable of receiving broadcast power, to a maximum distance of 150 miles. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. (As a result, Hellion has had to use a receiver array in Scrapwall, since the object he intends to charge is underground and farther than 75 miles away).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Power transmitted by this device is lost unless the device is programmed to transmit to a specific target capable of accepting a charge in range. Before a power relay can transmit, it must be linked to the target of its transmission to establish the transmission protocols. This consumes 10 charges and takes 1 minute to complete. Once completed, the distance between the power relay and the target of its transmissions can vary up to its maximum range. A small screen on the side of the power relay provides constant updates on the link, including bearings, distances, and the nature of the object to which it is linked. In the case of the power relay in this volume's adventure, that bearing and distance leads directly to Scrapwall-further information about this can be found in the next adventure, \"Lords of Rust.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This device essentially functions as a power generator that provides an hourly yield of charges to its target. For example, if a power relay that provided a yield of 40 charges was linked to a laser pistol, that laser pistol could be fired 40 times per hour without needing an additional charge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Power relays can only function a limited number of times before their delicate internal mechanisms burn out. Each time a power relay is used to initiate a new energy transfer, there's a cumulative 2% chance it burns out and becomes useless. Once a new transfer begins, a power relay can maintain that link between the generator and its target indefinitely (as long as there's always an available yield of at least 1 charge from the generator to keep itself powered). The power relay in this adventure has been used several times-the chance of burning out on its next activation is already at 50%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that a power relay has built-in signal boosters, and thus the range of its transmissions cannot be further increased through the use of additional signal boosters<sup>TG</sup>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":50,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Power Relay (Iron Gods)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":10,"max":10,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf-content.pf-tech.IF45u2rrSazMx0tZ"}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/sensor-yellow.webp","effects":[]}

All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours.

A neurocam can be adjusted to fit the head of any creature of size Tiny to Large. A neurocam interfaces with the subject's brain via a modulated beam of light that is transmitted through the optic nerves and several fine sensors that must press against the user's skull. Storing a person's mind takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted use; any interruption scrambles the pattern and ruins the neurocam. This process does not harm the target. An unwilling subject can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to resist a neurocam; if the subject is successful, the neurocam's contents are scrambled and the device is ruined.</p><p></p><p> A neurocam can store only one personality.

While one can use the electricity provided by a generator, these are rare, expensive, and rarely portable. It's more common and practical to charge such items with batteries. A battery looks like a small silver disk that's etched with strange lines-the people of Numeria have taken to calling batteries \"silverdisks\" and sometimes use them as coins. A battery contains 10 charges when full; to charge an item with a battery, one simply slips the disk-shaped device into the proper slot on the item. The battery's charge instantly fully depletes, and the item's internal capacitors fill with 10 charges as it does so. If the item had fewer than 10 open slots in its capacity, the excess charges the battery once held are lost. A battery can be kept within an object indefinitely, or it can be ejected from the object for the purposes of recharging it or storing it elsewhere without affecting the item's charge. Inserting or ejecting a battery is a move action.</p><p></p><p> Placing a battery in a generator's charging slot can recharge it. However, each time a battery is recharged, there's a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed in the process. A destroyed battery is worth only 10 gp. The bulk of Numerian \"silverdisks\" in circulation today are destroyed batteries; one can tell a functional battery from a destroyed one by the way the circuitry seems to shimmer slightly when reflecting light. The circuitry in a charged battery glows with a soft blue radiance equal to that of a candle.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25; <strong>Cost</strong> 50 gp</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":10,"max":10,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/fuse-copper.webp","effects":[],"_id":"KLrnwd8kfsRjlcUJ"}

Beam cannons are generally referred to by type as summarized below. In addition to the standard automatic firing mode options (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</em> 20), a beam cannon can be used to launch a devastating blast of energy. This is a full-round action, and these blasts can't be used to make iterative attacks. When a beam cannon is used to launch a blast, no attack roll is made-you simply target a 20-foot-radius spread within a maximum range of 300 feet. You must have line of effect to your target when you launch a blast; if the blast impacts a solid object before reaching the target area, it explodes at that point. All creatures caught in the blast radius take 6d6 points of damage of the energy type appropriate to the cannon (Reflex DC 14 half). Each blast also has an additional effect as determined by the type of cannon. Firing a blast from a beam cannon consumes 10 charges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Arc Cannon</strong>: An arc cannon deals electricity damage. Against metallic targets or creatures wearing medium or heavy metal armor, an arc cannon grants a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, and the save DC against its blast mode increases by 2. An arc cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>EMP Cannon</strong>: An EMP cannon fires electromagnetic energy that cannot harm most living creatures. It deals 4d6 points of electricity damage against robots, and half as much damage against androids and creatures with cybernetic implants. A creature that takes damage from a critical hit by an EMP cannon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. An EMP cannon's blast deals 8d6 points of electricity damage of the same electromagnetic nature. An EMP cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Gravity Cannon</strong>: A gravity cannon fires a beam of gravitons that deals force damage. Any creature that takes damage from its blast and fails the resulting Reflex save is encased in a shell of force energy for 1d4 rounds, as if by a <em>telekinetic sphere</em>. You can use a gravity cannon to move a sphere so created (at a speed of 30 feet, up to a range of 300 feet away) as a move action-every round during which you move a sphere in this way consumes 1 charge from the gravity cannon, but also maintains the moved sphere's duration for an additional round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the typical firing modes for a beam cannon, a gravity cannon can be fired on a sustained setting. When used in this mode, the gravity cannon can be used to move and manipulate objects from a distance, similar to the sustained force or combat maneuver versions of a <em>telekinesis</em> spell. (A gravity cannon can't duplicate the violent thrust option of a <em>telekinesis</em> spell.) The gravity cannon uses 1 charge per round in this mode, and can move objects weighing no more than 500 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the cannon uses the wielder's CMB + 8, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier. A gravity cannon is a technological artifact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Laser Cannon</strong>: A laser cannon deals fire damage. All attacks fired from it pass through transparent barriers, but treat fog, smoke, and other clouds as cover; see the laser pistol on page 25 of the <em>Technology Guide</em> for more information. A laser cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sonic Cannon</strong>: A sonic cannon deals sonic damage. A creature that is critically hit by a sonic cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon's blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be permanently deafened. A sonic cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Zero Cannon</strong>: A zero cannon deals cold damage. A creature that is critically hit by a zero cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon's blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become staggered for 1 round. A zero cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":18,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Beam Cannon (Iron Gods)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":50,"max":50,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"conditionals":[]},"flags":{"autoanimations":{"killAnim":false,"override":false,"animType":"t1","animName":"","bards":{"bardAnim":"a1","bardTarget":true,"bardTargetAnim":"a1","bardTargetColor":"a1","bardSelf":true,"marker":true,"markerColor":"a1","markerColorTarget":"a1"},"spellVar":"a1","hmAnim":"a1","color":"n1","spellOptions":{"spellLoops":1},"uaStrikeType":"physical","dtvar":"dt1","divineSmite":{"dsEnable":false,"dsSelf":true,"dsSelfDelay":0,"dsSelfColor":"a1","dsTarget":true,"dsTargetDelay":1250,"dsTargetColor":"a1"},"explosion":false,"explodeVariant":"ev1","explodeColor":"","explodeRadius":"0","explodeLoop":"1","allSounds":{"explosion":{"audioExplodeEnabled":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25},"item":{"enableAudio":false,"file":"","delay":100,"volume":25}},"selfRadius":"5","animTint":"#ffffff","auraOpacity":0.75,"ctaOption":false,"teleDist":30},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf-content.pf-tech.KSIF7CNJAulYPwjr"}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/metal-insert.webp","effects":[]}

A typical detonator has a range of 1,000 feet- though some may have a reduced range (intentionally or otherwise) and others might be enhanced by a signal booster (see page 51).</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 23; <strong>Cost</strong> 250 gp</p><p>Craft Technological Arms and Armor, military lab</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":500,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":10,"max":10,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/detonator-radio.webp","effects":[],"_id":"LHf8L2FLFkiqYmSB"}

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

On the primary setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect determined by its color-these effects mimic specific restorative spells as indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound ability can be healed).</p><p></p><p> A nanite hypogun functions only on a living, corporeal creature.

The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The dense plastic walls have hardness 8 and 10 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is selfsealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 27; <strong>Cost</strong> 9,000 gp</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":15,"price":18000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":60,"max":60,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"icons/sundries/misc/bird-house.webp","effects":[],"_id":"RioJyDE8jtNgDHWg"}

It manipulates photons and sound waves to produce highly realistic images and sounds, similar in nature to those generated by figment illusions.</p><p></p><p> Before a hologram generator can generate an image, though, it must store the image in its memory. The maximum size and maximum number of images a generator can store vary according to its color, but storing an image is a standard action regardless of the strength of the generator. More powerful generators can store moving images and sounds, or even generate illusions that interact with their environments.</p><p></p><p> Once a hologram generator's memory is full, additional images overwrite existing images as chosen by the user at the time of their recording.</p><p></p><p> Generating a hologram is a standard action. If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p></p><p> A hologram generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities, including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Brown Hologram Generator</strong>: A brown hologram generator can create only a static, motionless image no larger than a Small creature, and can store only one such image.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Black Hologram Generator</strong>: A black hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Medium creature, and can store three images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>White Hologram Generator</strong>: A white hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Large creature, and can store five images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Gray Hologram Generator</strong>: A gray hologram generator functions as a white hologram generator (and can store up to seven images), but can also store up to 1 minute of moving imagery as well. A moving hologram can move anywhere in range of the generator (see table on next page), as long as the user continues to take a move action each round to aim and direct the motion. An unattended generator's hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that area.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Green Hologram Generator</strong>: A green hologram generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image. It can store up to nine images or 2 minutes of moving imagery. It can store images equal in size to a Huge or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Red Hologram Generator</strong>: A red hologram generator functions as a green one, except that it can create two images within range simultaneously. Directing these images is a free action. A red hologram generator can store up to 11 images or 3 minutes of moving imagery. Blue Hologram Generator: A blue hologram generator functions as a red one, except that it can create three images simultaneously, can store up to 13 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Orange Hologram Generator</strong>: An orange hologram generator functions as a blue one, except that it can create up to four images simultaneously, can store up to 15 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery. In addition, it can store images equal in size to a Gargantuan or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prismatic Hologram Generator</strong>: A prismatic hologram generator functions as an orange one. As long as only one image is created, the image is further enhanced by graviton fields, which give it the ability to interact with the environment. (Such images still last for only 4 minutes.) A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score. On a successful hit, the hologram deals 2d6+6 points of force damage, regardless of the hologram's size.</p><p></p><p> <table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Range</strong></td><td><strong>Will</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>100 ft.</td><td>DC 11</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>20</td><td>200 ft.</td><td>DC 13</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>30</td><td>300 ft.</td><td>DC 14</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>40</td><td>400 ft.</td><td>DC 16</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>50</td><td>500 ft.</td><td>DC 17</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>60</td><td>600 ft.</td><td>DC 19</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>70</td><td>700 ft.</td><td>DC 20</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>80</td><td>800 ft.</td><td>DC 22</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>90</td><td>900 ft.</td><td>DC 23</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 27 (black), DC 32 (blue), DC 26 (brown), DC 29 (gray), DC 30 (green), DC 33 (orange), DC 34 (prismatic), DC 31 (red), DC 28 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 500 gp (black), 25,000 gp (blue), 250 gp (brown), 2,000 gp (gray), 15,000 gp (green), 30,000 gp (orange), 45,000 gp (prismatic), 20,000 gp (red), 1,000 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab (prismatic hologram generator requires a graviton lab)</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":4000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":40,"max":40,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"SSHEHI0DmCwtNXXh"}

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

An equally dizzying assortment of buttons, lights, and touch-sensitive screens adorn the device, both on the inside and outside of the pod.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An autodoc can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure disease, treat burns, implant cybertech, remove poison, and more. An autodoc can be programmed to perform any number of surgical procedures upon the person lying within the pod-the dozens of arms and devices work with precision and great speed. The operator need only enter in the proper diagnosis or desired operation on the screens at the foot of the bed with a successful Heal check; this requires the Technologist feat to attempt. The DC is based on the operation, detailed below. An autodoc will not activate until it has been properly programmed. Programming an operation takes 2d6 rounds of work. An autodoc has some capacity to error-check and auto-complete the correct programming for an operation before undertaking it by running instantaneous simulations on one of its many screens, granting the user a +5 circumstance bonus on these Heal checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An autodoc consumes 1 charge per hour while idle (including time needed to program an operation), and 1 charge per round while operating. As an autodoc can only hold a maximum of 120 charges at a time, for lengthy operations it must be recharged during use or be attached to a standing power supply such as a generator or reactor. While functioning, an autodoc is closed tight-a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to wrench the door open. A patient who leaves or is forcibly removed from an autodoc before an operation finishes (or who is being operated on when the autodoc runs out of charges) must succeed a DC 15 Reflex save or take 3d6+10 points of damage from the cutting lasers, surgical tools, and needles moving at high speed. Needless to say, exiting the autodoc before an operation completes negates any of the benefits that would have been otherwise granted by the device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The various operations an autodoc can perform are as follows; additional operations can be devised as needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minor Surgery</strong> (DC 15): The patient heals 1d8+1 points of damage. <em>Operation Time</em>: 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate Surgery</strong> (DC 20): The patient heals 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. <em>Operation Time</em>: 2 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Major Surgery</strong> (DC 25): The patient heals 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. <em>Operation Time</em>: 3 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Surgery</strong> (DC 30): The patient heals 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. <em>Operation Time</em>: 4 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Back from the Brink</strong> (DC 35): A dead patient whose body is relatively intact is restored to life at 1 hit point per Hit Die, as if by <em>raise dead</em> (including time restrictions and negative levels). <em>Operation Time</em>: 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Molecular Reconstruction</strong> (DC 45): As long as at least a small amount of a patient's DNA is available, an autodoc can reconstruct a patient's body completely.

When activated as a standard action, dozens of tiny biofeedback needles pierce the wearer's arms to interface with the nervous system; this process is somewhat painful and the wearer must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being dazed for 1 round as the force field is activated. Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams). The user of a force field can still breathe, but she cannot eat or drink.</p><p></p><p> Activating a force field is a standard action that consumes 1 charge, after which point the field consumes 1 additional charge every minute it remains active. While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks).

The maximum size and maximum number of images a generator can store vary according to its color, but storing an image is a standard action regardless of the strength of the generator. More powerful generators can store moving images and sounds, or even generate illusions that interact with their environments.</p><p></p><p> Once a hologram generator's memory is full, additional images overwrite existing images as chosen by the user at the time of their recording.</p><p></p><p> Generating a hologram is a standard action. If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p></p><p> A hologram generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities, including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Brown Hologram Generator</strong>: A brown hologram generator can create only a static, motionless image no larger than a Small creature, and can store only one such image.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Black Hologram Generator</strong>: A black hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Medium creature, and can store three images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>White Hologram Generator</strong>: A white hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Large creature, and can store five images.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Gray Hologram Generator</strong>: A gray hologram generator functions as a white hologram generator (and can store up to seven images), but can also store up to 1 minute of moving imagery as well. A moving hologram can move anywhere in range of the generator (see table on next page), as long as the user continues to take a move action each round to aim and direct the motion. An unattended generator's hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that area.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Green Hologram Generator</strong>: A green hologram generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image. It can store up to nine images or 2 minutes of moving imagery. It can store images equal in size to a Huge or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Red Hologram Generator</strong>: A red hologram generator functions as a green one, except that it can create two images within range simultaneously. Directing these images is a free action. A red hologram generator can store up to 11 images or 3 minutes of moving imagery. Blue Hologram Generator: A blue hologram generator functions as a red one, except that it can create three images simultaneously, can store up to 13 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Orange Hologram Generator</strong>: An orange hologram generator functions as a blue one, except that it can create up to four images simultaneously, can store up to 15 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery. In addition, it can store images equal in size to a Gargantuan or smaller creature.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prismatic Hologram Generator</strong>: A prismatic hologram generator functions as an orange one. As long as only one image is created, the image is further enhanced by graviton fields, which give it the ability to interact with the environment. (Such images still last for only 4 minutes.) A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score. On a successful hit, the hologram deals 2d6+6 points of force damage, regardless of the hologram's size.</p><p></p><p> <table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Range</strong></td><td><strong>Will</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>100 ft.</td><td>DC 11</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>20</td><td>200 ft.</td><td>DC 13</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>30</td><td>300 ft.</td><td>DC 14</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>40</td><td>400 ft.</td><td>DC 16</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>50</td><td>500 ft.</td><td>DC 17</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>60</td><td>600 ft.</td><td>DC 19</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>70</td><td>700 ft.</td><td>DC 20</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>80</td><td>800 ft.</td><td>DC 22</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>90</td><td>900 ft.</td><td>DC 23</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 27 (black), DC 32 (blue), DC 26 (brown), DC 29 (gray), DC 30 (green), DC 33 (orange), DC 34 (prismatic), DC 31 (red), DC 28 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 500 gp (black), 25,000 gp (blue), 250 gp (brown), 2,000 gp (gray), 15,000 gp (green), 30,000 gp (orange), 45,000 gp (prismatic), 20,000 gp (red), 1,000 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab (prismatic hologram generator requires a graviton lab)</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":90000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":90,"max":90,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"dhoGy8ZdsjW0L9xg"}

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

Full rules for memory facets can be found on pages 62�63 of <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>, including rules for aggression facets, ego facets, and inhibitor facets.

In addition, the facet grants the AI the ability to bolster the programming of any robot within 30 feet as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its CR. A bolstered robot gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. The AI can target an aggregate (<em>Technology Guide</em> 59) under its control with this effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Entropy Facet</strong>: This memory facet enhances an AI's capacity to understand and interpret chaos theory and probabilities, allowing it to more swiftly react to and mimic emotions. The facet grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the AI's Charisma score. In addition, up to three times per day when the AI rolls a d20, it can roll twice and take either result as an immediate action. This ability must be used after the first roll but before the results are revealed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Guile Facet</strong>: This facet augments the AI's skills at deception and trickery. The facet grants a +4 bonus on Bluff checks. When the AI attempts a Sense Motive check to see through a Bluff, it rolls twice and takes the higher result.

A small slot situated below the window can accept genetic material (fingernails, hair clippings, skin samples, and so forth). When genetic material is placed in the slot, the clonepod immediately atomizes the sample and processes the genetic information. At this point, activating the clonepod causes its interior to flood with blue biotic fluid, which is then supersaturated with a combination of proteins, nanites, and other materials. Over the course of the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a Medium or smaller creature-attempts to clone a larger creature result in a hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times before dying.</p><p></p><p> The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is alive, yet has no mind until a neurocam (see page 50) is used to upload a mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both 1.</p><p></p><p> Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the effects of a <em>clone</em> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points of Constitution drain)-provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the Boneyard and been judged. It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged results in a soulless approximation of the original.

Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams).

While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects.

A short spigot protrudes from the opposite side. The other four sides of the box are covered with panels that flash and hum in a repeating pattern. This device operates as a nutrient dispenser. Once per day, when any panel is pushed as a full-round action, the node extrudes a dollop of nutrient paste from the spigot. This paste contains sufficient nutrients to sustain a single Medium or smaller creature for one day. For 24 hours after use, the tiny hoses take in trace amounts of air, dirt, or any other nearby substances and the node processes the matter into more nutrient paste.</p><p></p><p> The default nutrient paste is foul-tasting. However, if the panels are pushed in a fashion that matches the repeating pattern flashing on the box (Intelligence DC 10), the node introduces nanites that render the paste delicious.

When an Intelligence check is failed, the machine produces foul-tasting paste and the Intelligence DC resets to 10 on the following day.

A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score. On a successful hit, the hologram deals 2d6+6 points of force damage, regardless of the hologram's size.</p><p></p><p> <table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Range</strong></td><td><strong>Will</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>100 ft.</td><td>DC 11</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>20</td><td>200 ft.</td><td>DC 13</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>30</td><td>300 ft.</td><td>DC 14</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>40</td><td>400 ft.</td><td>DC 16</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>50</td><td>500 ft.</td><td>DC 17</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>60</td><td>600 ft.</td><td>DC 19</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>70</td><td>700 ft.</td><td>DC 20</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>80</td><td>800 ft.</td><td>DC 22</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>90</td><td>900 ft.</td><td>DC 23</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 27 (black), DC 32 (blue), DC 26 (brown), DC 29 (gray), DC 30 (green), DC 33 (orange), DC 34 (prismatic), DC 31 (red), DC 28 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 500 gp (black), 25,000 gp (blue), 250 gp (brown), 2,000 gp (gray), 15,000 gp (green), 30,000 gp (orange), 45,000 gp (prismatic), 20,000 gp (red), 1,000 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab (prismatic hologram generator requires a graviton lab)</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":40000,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"passive"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":60,"max":60,"per":"charges","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"oAGYEfyjja9wOkWp"}

An access card functions as a key-when swiped through an electronic lock (a move action), an access card unlocks any lock of its color code or a color code of a lower rating.

Among certain societies in Numeria, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.</p><p></p><p> Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don't work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another. Coding an access card for specific locks requires a lock coder (see page 44). Some access cards could be worth far more than the prices listed above if they're specifically encoded to locks that protect more valuable or significant contents.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 16 (black), DC 21 (blue), DC 15 (brown), DC 18 (gray), DC 19 (green), DC 22 (orange), DC 23 (prismatic), DC 20 (red), DC 17 (white)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> 5 gp (black), 180 gp (blue), 1 gp, 5 sp (brown), 45 gp (gray), 80 gp (green), 245 gp (orange), 500 gp (prismatic), 125 gp (red), 20 gp (white)</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":10,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Access card (black)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"subType":"gear","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/bills.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"qTKyPzhSxYna7qNv"}

An envoy's mouthpiece is a circlet worn across the mouth, with slender arms that reach along the jaw to wrap around the wearer's skull and hold the device in place. Two thin earpieces extend up from the band to slip unobtrusively into the user's ears once a mouthpiece is donned. When created, an envoy's mouthpiece is encoded with a specific single language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of the wearer, the mouthpiece translates that language into Androffan. In addition, any words spoken in Androffan by the wearer are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between the wearer and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy's mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other than the one it has been programmed to translate, but a newly created mouthpiece could, in theory, translate languages into something other than Androffan.</p><p></p><p> An envoy's mouthpiece automatically records any words spoken through it, allowing anything said through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button on the lower right side. Up to 30 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner.

The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat (see page 7) succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the cortex gun's programming was scrambled, the nanites die without doing any harm or aid to the target.</p><p></p><p> If the cortex gun was properly programmed to one of the six ability scores, the nanites swiftly disperse through the user's body, enhancing and augmenting that ability score over the course of several days. These augmentations are inherent bonuses, and increase the ability score by 1 every 24 hours that pass until the cortex gun's maximum bonus is reached.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun can only function on living corporeal creatures, but a living creature with a bonus granted by a cortex gun that dies and becomes undead retains that bonus in undeath.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun can only be used once before it becomes useless.

The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat (see page 7) succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds.

The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat (see page 7) succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p></p><p> A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds.
