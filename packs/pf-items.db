When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":75,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bonePaste","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/slime-white.webp","effects":[],"_id":"0N1uQZTpvQfbU2nJ"}

Nostalgia oil can also be thrown as a splash weapon, extending its benefits for 1 hour to any Pathfinder struck with a direct hit. Alternatively, a creature can mix it with a pint of lantern oil or piece of incense, which grants half the nostalgia oil's benefits to all Pathfinders within 20 feet of the lantern or censor for 1 hour; any strong wind (21+ mph) dissipates the aroma for 1 minute.<br/><br/> Crafting a vial of nostalgia oil requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.

Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments.

When injected into a mostly intact corpse of a Medium or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than 1 day (time spent under effects like <em>gentle repose</em> don't count against this time), the fluid gives the corpse a rudimentary semblance of life, reactivating its nerves and muscle tissue. This causes the corpse to reanimate and shamble around erratically for 1 minute. The result is not an undead creature, nor is it a construct. The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn, roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next. On a 1, it continues forward in the same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier). On a 2, it turns 45* clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90* clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on. The corpse can't attack, doesn't defend itself, and-as an object-has AC 10 and 12 hit points.

A candle made from alchemical candle wax normally possesses a sweet, honeylike smell, but a character who is trained in Craft (alchemy) can infuse the wax with nearly any scent available to her. A character trained in both Craft (alchemy) and Craft (poison) can infuse one candle's worth of wax with any alchemical substance that requires inhalation, such as a vial of alchemical pheromones (see below) or a dose of inhaled poison. When infusing the wax with poison, the normal rules for exposing oneself to poison apply. Only one kind of alchemical substance can be infused into a single candle at a time, though a single candle can hold up to 3 doses of a substance. A single lump of alchemical candle wax is enough to create one candle.<br/><br/> After burning for 1 minute, the alchemical candle releases the chosen alchemical substance as a colorless haze that lingers in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle for up to 1 hour, plus 30 minutes for each dose or vial of a substance infused into the candle wax beyond the first. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the haze in 2 rounds; a strong or stronger wind (21+ mph) disperses the haze immediately.

This deals only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.<br/><br/> Filling an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) or Sleight of Hand check to avoid spilling the alchemical item on yourself.

Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"antivenom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Remedies"]]},"consumableType":"potion","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"NPBagFBBa3zdvQHU"}

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round. Whether the target succeeds at or fails the saving throw, it becomes immune to simple alchemical pheromones for 24 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Susceptibility</strong>: Affected creatures are forced to obey one specific, simple command, as if affected by a <em>command</em> spell.

It allows the wearer to deliver a dose of contact or ingested poison by means of a kiss. This kiss can be to the hand, cheek, or other exposed skin to deliver a contact poison, but must be on the mouth for an ingested poison. A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous. To use poison lip paint without being exposed to the poison, the wearer must first apply a protective layer of base material. When using an ingested poison, the wearer can instead consume an antidote prior to application. (When the user applies a contact poison, preemptively consuming an antidote results in the wearer's skin harmlessly absorbing the poison, as does immunity to poison.) A kit contains enough base material and lip paint for 10 doses. The poisons must be purchased separately and mixed into the lip paint.

This greater splash weapon deals no damage, but those within its primary area of effect-the target and those within 5 feet of the target or those within 5 feet of the intersection-must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds.<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Splash Weapon</h2>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 35","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":25,"price":150,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["",""],["",""]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":0},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"fort","description":""},"effectNotes":"see text","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"noxiousPig","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Weapons"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-3.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"SQZPW4lB50rwcP1a"}

(common), 15 lbs. (masterwork)<h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2>This plain but heavy iron helmet covers the entire head and fastens around the neck and shoulders. The wearer becomes difficult to identify, as the mask obscures all facial features. A creature wearing an iron mask is always treated as having made an involuntary Disguise skill check with a result of 10 (with no further modifiers). Additionally, the creature can only apply half its Dexterity modifier to Dexterity checks, Dexterity- based skill checks, initiative checks, and Reflex saving throws. The creature adds only half of its Dexterity modifier to its Armor Class and CMD, and to attack rolls, if applicable. The creature treats all other creatures as if they had concealment against it.<br/><br/> A creature wearing an iron mask can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 35, or DC 40 for a masterwork iron mask). Breaking the mask requires a Strength check (DC 30, or DC 32 for a masterwork iron mask). An iron mask has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. Half the damage dealt to an iron mask applies to the creature wearing it.<br/><br/> Iron masks are typically designed for Medium creatures, but Small ones can be bought for the same price, or larger ones can be bought for higher prices (the price is calculated the same way as buying larger-sized manacles; see page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>). Most iron masks have locks; add the cost of the desired lock to the price of the mask. Masterwork masks also often feature frightening or demeaning sculpted visages.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":15,"price":150,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"maskIronMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"clothing","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"mask","masterwork":false,"size":"med","broken":false,"nonlethal":false,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/equipment/head/mask-carved-scream-tan.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Tr7sLJK5gZu6Dl7K"}

A snuff addict can stave off withdrawal for 5 days by taking a dose; failure means he must save or take 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage.

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round.

A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon contact with a hard surface, the blanch bomb releases a hazy cloud of gas within a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the point of impact. This cloud lasts for 1d4+1 rounds and can be dispersed as fog cloud. If a creature whose damage reduction is overcome by the specified substance begins its turn in the affected area, the subject's DR/adamantine, DR/cold iron, or DR/silver (depending on the type of blanch bomb used) degrades at a rate of 1 point per round for as long as the creature remains in the area (to a minimum of DR 0). If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.<br/><br/> <b>Mythic</b>: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier. The gas created by the blanch bomb lasts an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier, and it cannot be dispersed by wind.

Inside, festering chunks of monkey meat are covered in fungal mycelium and seeded with fly eggs, though the mixture's potency is not evident until it's exposed to air. Once the jar is opened (a standard action), the stench quickly becomes overpowering as the jar's contents swell and rot at an accelerated rate. Any living creature within 15 feet of the jar when it is opened must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.<br/><br/> Vermin and undead have a hard time distinguishing carrion bait from rotten human flesh, but intelligent undead that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check realize the difference. Regardless, any creature that spends more than 1 round eating the carrion bait quickly realizes its error, since the bait continues to swell and grow even as it's digested.

The sturdy container features a padded interior with numerous straps and compartments so that the items within aren't damaged in transport. The altar's surface prominently features a deity's holy symbol, and it's sturdy enough that it can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift pulpit.<br/><br/> Among the items found within the altar are the tools and materials necessary to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and professions the related deity deems sacred, as well as holy texts written to inspire greatness in the deity's followers. The user can expend some of the materials within the altar to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Craft check of the specified type (see below).<br/><br/> In addition, after spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within the altar, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus applies (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour of praying and reading the altar's scriptures or lose the bonus-the mantras and inspiration provided by the texts having drifted from her mind. This hour of prayer and scripture reading can be integrated with the time a cleric uses to prepare her spells. Regardless, using the masterwork portable altar in this manner expends the altar's materials in the same way that using the normal altar to bolster a Craft check does.<br/><br/> A masterwork portable altar can be used multiple times, but after 20 uses, it must be restocked with 50 gp worth of sanctified materials-preferably purchased from a temple of the associated deity. The altar grants no bonuses on skill checks if used while its materials are depleted, though it can still be employed as a normal portable altar.<br/><br/> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td><strong>Deity</strong></td><td><strong>Favored Craft</strong></td><td><strong>Aided Skill</strong></td><tr> <tr><td>Abadar</td><td>Craft (jewelry)</td><td>Appraise</td><tr> <tr><td>Asmodeus</td><td>Craft (calligraphy)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Calistria</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Bluff</td><tr> <tr><td>Cayden Cailean</td><td>Craft (leather)</td><td>Ride</td><tr> <tr><td>Desna</td><td>Craft (clothing)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Erastil</td><td>Craft (bows)</td><td>Survival</td><tr> <tr><td>Gorum</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Gozreh</td><td>Craft (ships)</td><td>Handle Animal</td><tr> <tr><td>Iomedae</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Irori</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Acrobatics</td><tr> <tr><td>Lamashtu</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Nethys</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Spellcraft</td><tr> <tr><td>Norgorber</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr> <tr><td>Pharasma</td><td>Craft (pottery)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Rovagug</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Sarenrae</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Heal</td><tr> <tr><td>Shelyn</td><td>Craft (any art)</td><td>Perform (any)</td><tr> <tr><td>Torag</td><td>Craft (stonemasonry)</td><td>Climb</td><tr> <tr><td>Urgathoa</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Disguise</td><tr> <tr><td>Zon-Kuthon</td><td>Craft (locks)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":40,"price":400,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"altarPortableMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Tools"]]},"subType":"gear","equipped":true,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/laboratory/alembic-glass-ball-blue.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Z6myw3MzuGU4icLp"}

Used for climbing as well as combat, these grayish, gourdlike pouches are made of a specially grown fungus with a tough but rubbery exterior. The fungoid is carefully harvested, pierced at one end, hollowed out, and then injected with a strong alchemical adhesive that hardens to a fibrous material almost instantly when exposed to air. When squeezed, a spider sac's adhesive shoots out to a maximum range of 10 feet and sticks to whatever it strikes, whereupon the strand dries instantly into a durable fibrous rope. For the purposes of climbing, treat a spider sac as a grappling hook except that all surfaces are AC 5. A spider sac can also be used as a lasso except with AC 10, 4 hit points, and a DC 24 Strength check to burst.

A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon contact with a hard surface, the blanch bomb releases a hazy cloud of gas within a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the point of impact. This cloud lasts for 1d4+1 rounds and can be dispersed as fog cloud. If a creature whose damage reduction is overcome by the specified substance begins its turn in the affected area, the subject's DR/adamantine, DR/cold iron, or DR/silver (depending on the type of blanch bomb used) degrades at a rate of 1 point per round for as long as the creature remains in the area (to a minimum of DR 0). If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.<br/><br/> <b>Mythic</b>: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier. The gas created by the blanch bomb lasts an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier, and it cannot be dispersed by wind.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.<br/><br/> A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of <i>universal solvent</i> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.

If a dose of anderos salve is applied at least twice per week over a period of months, the user's feminine secondary sex characteristics are gradually reduced and masculine ones develop; imbibing mulibrous tincture in this way reduces the drinker's masculine secondary sex characteristics and feminine ones develop.

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round. Whether the target succeeds at or fails the saving throw, it becomes immune to simple alchemical pheromones for 24 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Susceptibility</strong>: Affected creatures are forced to obey one specific, simple command, as if affected by a <em>command</em> spell.

Instead of a Disable Device DC, decoy triggers have a Sense Motive DC. If a creature succeeds at the decoy's Sense Motive check, it immediately recognizes the decoy trigger as a fake, and the real trap loses the bonus to its Perception DC.

When introduced into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check. A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect's duration has expired.<br/><br/> If an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.<br/><br/> When ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.<br/><br/> Crafting necrobane formaldehyde requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 23","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":60,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"necrobaneFormaldehyde","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"oFJcOy0C1LljHL06"}

A direct hit from a fiery boulder deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 5 points of fire damage to every creature affected by its splash damage. All creatures affected by a fiery boulder's direct damage take an additional 2d6 points of fire damage the following round; affected creatures can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Splash Weapon</h2>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 30","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["2d6","fire"],["",""]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":0},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"fieryBoulder","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Weapons"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/stone/ore-chunk-red.webp","effects":[],"_id":"oNay37Eabj4P0W76"}

Given a minute, a catfolk can create a scent mixture and apply it to a solid object, such as a tree, a wall, or even a smaller item such as a weapon or potion vial. When the catfolk does this, it leaves one of the following scent impressions: danger, food, shelter, or possession. The possession impression is always keyed to the specific catfolk using the kit, and signifies that she owns the territory or item. Other races can attempt to use this kit to create the danger, food, or shelter impression, but doing so requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A catfolk can detect a particular scent applied with a trailscent kit from 30 feet away. If the scent is upwind, the range at which a catfolk can detect the scent increases to 60 feet; if it is downwind, the range drops to 15 feet. A catfolk with the scent racial quality doubles those distances. A scent impression lasts for 1 year or until it is washed away.

Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus.

It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.<br/><br/> Any creature with the water affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks elemental brine finds her innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a sorcerer with the elemental (water) bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the creature is a cleric with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.<br/><br/> Creatures with the aquatic subtype that imbibe elemental brine become immune to poison, although poisons active when the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater, it also becomes undetectable by scent for the same duration. Both of these effects last 24 hours.<br/><br/> Finally, elemental brine can be used as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a bottle of elemental brine is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition, a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay between elemental brine's salt and water and the creature's flames, making the target more conductive and thus more susceptible to electrocution. Anytime the target would take electricity damage within the next minute, it must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1-1/2 times as much electricity damage as normal.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":500,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"10","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["2d6","salt water"],["",""]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":0},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"ref","description":""},"effectNotes":"see text","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"elementalBrine","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Weapons"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-2.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"uIpJRuythtfo5zAO"}

It's used to coat the surface of objects, protecting them from a specific type of energy damage. Though elemental proofing is not harmful to the objects it coats, it acts as a contact poison to living creatures. Touching elemental proofing directly causes 1d4 points of damage and 1d4 rounds of sickness (a DC 14 Fortitude save negates the latter effect). Creatures immune to poison are likewise immune to the effects of contacting elemental proofing but gain no benefits from its application. When applied to weapons or armor, elemental proofing confers resistances to the coated object, but none to the wearer.<br/><br/> Each vial of elemental proofing contains enough gel to coat one Large object, or two Medium or smaller objects. Once the applied gel dries, it absorbs 10 points of the specified type of elemental damage each round. Elemental proofing wears off after 24 hours, and multiple applications of the gel do not stack. There are four different types of elemental proofing: acid proofing provides acid resistance 10, flame proofing provides fire resistance 10, frost proofing provides cold resistance 10, and lightning proofing provides electricity resistance 10.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"elementalProofing","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/bowl-liquid-red.webp","effects":[],"_id":"wKI7Nc43cQnqV6jk"}

Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":50,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"goldenMapleLeaves","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[["Category","Alchemical Tools"]]},"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/plant-pot.webp","effects":[],"_id":"wXy5RApXVSdFIpyG"}

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round.
