# pf1e-content
converted/imported content for Foundry VTT PF1e

This module comprises a host of content for pathfinder 1st ed. for foundry. .

## Included Content:
~4,200 magic items (including ammo, rods, weapons, armor, artifacts, cursed items, staffs, and wondrous items)

~2930 Feats

~620 traits

And a handful of buff effects

The items/features are not perfect. None of them contain the appropriate Changes, attacks, armor bonuses, etc.. However, the entire item description as well as most of the relevant info needed to make them are typically included. Several of the magic items have default art pointing towards the pf1 system, but most are missing art. 

If you intend to make changes (you probably will), I strongly recommend creating a personal copy of the databases so any changes you make don't get overwritten.

# Templates for Data Toolbox for Foundry VTT:
Within the templates folder is the .json files I used, however they required a significant amount of cleaning of the excel files to work without issue. You can contact me if you would like access to the cleaned file.

Not all the information is present in the items, however, all the important bits are included in the description of each, so making the appropriate bonuses/attack, etc. shouldn't be too diffiult.
